#Introduction
We've all experienced that our favorite IDE throws phantom errors and the project can't compile. To resolve this issue, you must close and reopen the IDE.
In order to simplify the restart process, this extension was created.

#Using
You can use extensions from the ``Tools``&rarr;``Restart Visual Studio`` menu.
Also, for greater convenience, you can use the keyboard shortcut ``Crtl+R, Ctrl+F5``
